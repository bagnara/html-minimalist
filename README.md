## Introduction

HTML Minimalist was designed and structured in the simplest way possible in order to provide an open-source and responsive template for personal and professional websites. HTML, CSS and JavaScript minification, image optimization, JavaScript code transpilation, and live reload are available by default. Furthermore, the build process is simple, efficient, and reliable.

## Technologies

HTML Minimalist was designed using **Adobe XD** and structured using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. **Gulp** is used in order to automate HTML, CSS and JavaScript minification, image optimization and JavaScript code transpilation during the development and building processes. **Browsersync** provides the development server with live reload.

## Installation

In order to clone the repository, you need to run the command `git clone https://github.com/bagnara/html-minimalist.git` and then install the dependencies using `npm install`. Once you have the repository cloned and the dependencies installed, run the command `npm run start` in order to execute the Gulp task responsible for watching the source code, as well as starting the development server.

## Contribution

The master branch is protected, therefore, you will need to commit your changes to the respective branch / branches and then create your pull request. I recommend following the **Gitflow** branching model and the **Conventional Commits** specification. Once your pull request is approved, the predefined **GitHub Actions** will take care of the deployment process.
